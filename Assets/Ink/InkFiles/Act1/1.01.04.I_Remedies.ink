== remedyLeeches ==

{physician: Leeches. Magical little creatures, to the uneducated. To you, they are medical instruments â€” perhaps even collaborators in your work. Bloodletting is already a great tool of the healer, but leeches provide additional benefits. Their saliva has anesthetic and anticoagulant properties and they avoid the messiness of letting blood with a blade.}

{apothecary: Leeches. Not your favorite remedy, but you must admit the little creatures have their uses. Their saliva is known to relieve pain and help blood flow through the veins.}

{barber: Leeches. Bloodletting is a versatile remedy, though you prefer the use of blades to these odd little worms.}

{charlatan: Leeches. Unsettling little parasites. Healers seem to use them for everything, surely a few couldn't hurt.}
